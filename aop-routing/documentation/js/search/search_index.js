The function should return an observable. The RouteNextAsync will subscribe to the passed observable and automatically perform imperative navigation.\nThe method should return an Observable or AopNavigator object which the decorator will use to perform imperative navigation\n\nBelow example will make the decorator subscribe to the Observable value returned from the targeted method and use that value to perform\nimperative routing.\n@RouteNextAsync()\npublic testMethod(): Observable {\n...some logic...\nreturn of(1, 2, 3).pipe(\nswitchMap(x => {\n  return of('page1');\n})\n);\n}\n\n\nBelow example will make the decorator subscribe to the AopNavigator object returned from the targeted method and use the destinationPage property value to perform\nimperative routing.\n@RouteNextAsync()\npublic testMethod(): Observable {\n...some logic...\n\nconst obj: AopNavigator = {\ndestinationPage: 'Test2',\n};\n\nreturn of(1, 2, 3).pipe(\nswitchMap(x => {\n return of(obj);\n})\n);\n}NavigationExtras for RouteNext and RouteNextAsync\nAn Angular NavigationExtras object can be passed to RouteNext and RouteNextAsync to allow extra options to modify the Router navigation strategy.\n\n\nThe below example will route to page1 and set the Router skipLocationChange to true\n@RouteNext('page1',  {skipLocationChange: true})\npublic testMethod(): void {\n ...some logic...\n}RouteBack\n RouteBack decorator when used on a targeted method, will automatically perform popstate navigation back to the previous page after the end of the targeted method execution.\n @RouteBack()\n public testMethod() {\n  ...some logic...\n }RouteBackAsync\nThe RouteBackAsync decorator can be used on a function which performs rxjs aysnchronous operations. The function should return an observable. The RouteBackAsync will subscribe to the passed observable and automatically perform popstate navigation to the previous page.\n\nBelow example will popstate navigate back to previous page after the asynchronous operation inside the method is complete.@RouteBackAsync()\npublic testMethod() {\nreturn of(...some async operations).pipe(\n...rxjs operators...)\n}\n\nRouteToState\nRouteToState decorator when used on a targeted method, will automatically perform popste navigation to the destination page in the history state. If a negative number is provided, RouteToState will popstate naivage backwards equivalent to the passed integer, likewise it will popstate navigate forwards for a positive integer.\n\nBelow example will traverse 2 states backwards of the browser history state\n@RouteToState(-2)\npublic testMethod() {\n...some logic...\n}\nBelow example will traverse 2 states forward of the browser history state\n@RouteToState(2)\npublic testMethod() {\n...some logic...\n}\n\nRouteToStateAsync\nThe RouteToStateAsync decorator can be used on a function which performs rxjs aysnchronous operations. The function should return an observable. The RouteToStateAsync will subscribe to the passed observable and automatically perform popstate navigation traversion of the history state.\n\nBelow example will subscribe to the targeted method and use the returned value to traverse -2 states backwards of the browser history state after end of targeted method.\n@RouteToStateAsync()\npublic testMethod(): Observable {\n...some logic...\nreturn of(1, 2, 3).pipe(\n switchMap(x => {\n   return of(-2);\n })\n);\n}\nBelow example will make the decorator subscribe to the AopNavigator object returned from the targeted method and use the destinationPage property value to perform\n\n\npopstate navigation traversal of the browser history state.\n @RouteToStateAsync()\n public testMethod(): Observable {\n   ...some logic...\n\n    const obj: AopNavigator = {\n     destinationPage: -2',\n   };\n\n   return of(1, 2, 3).pipe(\n    switchMap(x => {\n      return of(obj);\n    })\n  );\n }\nAopNavigator Interface capabilities\nAopNavigator interface contains the following properties that can be used to enhance the decorator functionalities.\n\ndestinationPage - This property can be passed a string or numeric value that can be used for the RouteNext, RouteNextAsync, RouteToState and RouteToStateAsync decorators to perform navigation.\n\nnavigationExtra - This property takes an Angular NavigationExtras object to allow extra options to modify the Router navigation strategy for RouteNext and RouteNextAsync decorator.\n\npreprocess - This property takes a reference function. This function will be executed prior to any navigations performed by the decorators.\n\nparam - This property will take a value of any type that can be used as parameter(s) for the passed function in the preprocess property.\n\n\n\nCustom user defined navigation logic\nCustom logic can be passed to the AopRouting library to override the default navigation logic of the decorators.\n\nCreate a class that extends the AopBaseNavigation abstract class.\nexport class SampleClass extends AopBaseNavigation {}\nImplement the required abstract methods of the AopBaseNavigation abstract class.\n\n\n\ngoToNextPage()\ngoToPreviousPage()\ngoToState()\n\nexport class SampleClass extends AopBaseNavigation {\n public goToNextPage(...) {\n  ...custom logic...\n}\n\n public goToPreviousPage(...) {\n  ...custom logic...\n}\n\n public goToState(...) {\n  ...custom logic...\n}\n\nIn the top level/root module add the AopProxyNavigationService to the providers array and set the useClass to the newly created class@NgModule({\nimports: [\n ...\n AopRoutingModule\n],\nproviders: [{provide: AopProxyNavigationService, useClass: SampleClass}],\n})\nThe above steps will override the default decorator navigation logic, which means the decorators will now use the custom methods of the newly created class SampleClass\n\n\nExperiemental Features\nAopRouting can dynamically modify the routing table during runtime of an Angular application.\n- Note the below features are experimental and should be used with cautionTo enable the experimental features of the AopRouting library, pass an object with experimentalNav property set to true to the AopRoutingModule forRoot method to the top level/root module:\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    AopRoutingModule.forRoot({expirementNav: true})\n  ],\n  ...\n})The below Routing table will be used to demonstrate the features and examples:\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {path: 'page1', component: Page1Component},\n  {path: 'page2', component: Page2Component }\n];Adding new Path to the Routing Table at runtime.\nA new Path can be dynamically created and to the Routing table and also navigated to at runtime . Suppose we want to add page3 that should route to Page3Component\n\nCreate a routeTransform object and set the path and *component property:\nconst routeTransform: RouteTransform = {\n path: 'page3',\n component: Page3Component\n};\nIn the RouteNext or RouteNextAsync deocrator of the targeted function, return an AopNav object with the routeTransform property set.\n\n\n@RouteNext()\npublic testMethod() {\n  const routeTransform: RouteTransform = {\n    path: 'page3',\n    component: Page3Component\n };\n  return {routeTransform}\n}Changing component of a Path at runtime\nA component that has been statically set to a path can be changed and navigated to at runtime. Suppose we want to change page1 to route to Page3Component instead:\n\nCreate a routeTransform object and set the path and *component property:\nconst routeTransform: RouteTransform = {\n path: 'page1',\n component: Page3Component\n};\nIn the RouteNext or RouteNextAsync deocrator of the targeted function, return an AopNav object with the routeTransform property set:\n\n\n@RouteNext()\npublic testMethod() {\n  const routeTransform: RouteTransform = {\n    path: 'page1',\n    component: Page3Component\n };\n  return {routeTransform}\n}Add CanActivate guard(s) at runtime\nCanActivate guards can be added to a path at runtime. Suppose we want to add a guard page1 path\n\nCreate a routeTransform object and set the path1 and canActivateGuards property by providing the name(s) of CanActivate guard(s) to be added:\nconst routeTransform: RouteTransform = {\n path: 'page1',\n canActivateGuards: [guard1, guard2]\n};\nIn the RouteNext or RouteNextAsync deocrator of the targeted function, return an AopNav object with the routeTransform property set:\n\n\n@RouteNext()\npublic testMethod() {\n  const routeTransform: RouteTransform = {\n    path: 'page1',\n    canActivateGuards: [guard1, guard2]\n };\n  return {routeTransform}\n}Removing guard(s) from a path\nTo remove CanActivate guards from a path at runtime, it's the same steps as adding guards. If the guards provided exist in the routing table, they will be removed.\nRemoving all CanActivate guards associated to a path.\nTo remove all CanActivate guards associated to a path is the same steps as adding a guard. Instead the canActivateGuards property should be set to an empty array.\n@RouteNext()\npublic testMethod() {\n  const routeTransform: RouteTransform = {\n    path: 'page1',\n    canActivateGuards: []\n };\n  return {routeTransform}\n}- Changes made to the Routing table are not persistent. They are reverted back upon completion of navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        AopRoutingModule\n                    \n                    \n                                \n                                    No graph available.\n                                \n                        \n                            Browse\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n  \n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n\ndependencies\n\nLegend\n\n  Declarations\n\n  Module\n\n  Bootstrap\n\n  Providers\n\n  Exports\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Zoom in\n        Reset\n        Zoom out\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        1 Module\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    2 Injectables\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    8 Classes\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    3 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            context   (projects/.../test.ts)\n                        \n                        \n                            require   (projects/.../test.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    projects/aop-routing/src/test.ts\n    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                            context\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Default value : require.context('./', true, /\\.spec\\.ts$/)\n                        \n                    \n\n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                            require\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Type :         any\n\n                        \n                    \n\n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
